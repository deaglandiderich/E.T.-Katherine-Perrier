Hey so this is our project, I couldn't get the videos to play in the game so just play them when the dialogue boxes say *PLAY VIDEO 1* or whatever.

to play the game, go into Resources and run SFMLProject.exe.

Arrow keys to select options in the menus, spacebar to confirm selection, advance text or skip text scrolling.

If you don't want to play the game you can access all the text thru the Assets folder, and obviously watch the vids in the video folder.
There are 2 easter eggs and 1 secret true ending, which 'reveals' the 4th cutscene. You can get all the cutscenes to play in one route
or all the easter eggs, but not both.

I, Deaglan Diderich, programmed the game, and played Warshaw and Spielberg in the film.
Jennjamin Colavincenzo wrote the story and filmed and edited the cutscenes, and played Employee A.
Sevan Dumanian wrote the informative learning aid E.T.-FINAL.docx and researched sources, and played Employee B
Kyle Kirby played the CEO of Atari. 

Sincerely, 
Deaglan,
Jenn,
and Sevan
